		Ternary operator(?):
		 Ternary operators have three basic parts. The first part is the condition. The condition goes in parentheses. After a question mark, there is a bit of code to perform if the conditional is true. Then after a colon, you need to place what will happen if the operator is false. All three sections must be completed.
		 OR
		The ternary operator, or conditional operator, takes three arguments and is basically a shortened way of writing an if-else statement.*/
